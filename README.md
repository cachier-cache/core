    TODO:
        - add an expiry, might need to restructure how it works, (use numbers)
        - make the get more efficient as it is somewhat of a big string, it should just be the value or empty string if non-existent key
-->

<!-- TODO: protocol buffers:
    - this would need to be another server
    - another repo
    - maybe a flag on the client library to select which one to use (tcp or pb)
    - possibly a way to have it on the same server i.e. this main.rs file?
