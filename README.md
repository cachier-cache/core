<!-- TODO: add GET, PUT appended to a string so that the server knows when to return a value or something -->

<!-- TODO: add an expiry, might need to restructure how it works, (use numbers) -->

<!-- TODO: protocol buffers:
    - this would need to be another server
    - another repo
    - maybe a flag on the client library to select which one to use (tcp or pb)
    - possibly a way to have it on the same server i.e. this main.rs file?
